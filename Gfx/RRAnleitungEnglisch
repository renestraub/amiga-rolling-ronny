PLEASE NOTE: The current version of ROLLING RONNY is a demonstration
             version only. The level designs are not yet completed.
             Only two (of the five planned) levels are ready to run in
             this demo-version. The errands in this version (see "how
             to play ROLLING RONNY) are just simple test-and-try samples.
             We are still working on more sophisticated and tricky 
             errands and jobs for Ronny. Only very few sound effects
             could be implemented up to now. The difficulty level
             has still to be corrected and adapted for the final version.
             We are positive about finishing the game until Christmas 1990
             or early (January/February) next year. But we are sure that
             this game is going to be addictive and great fun to play!

                               How to Play

***************************** ROLLING RONNY ****************************        


The World of Rolling Ronny:
---------------------------
     Ronny is a clever and smart English errand boy who is never seen
     on an errand without his roller-skates allowing him to move
     very quickly through the streets of his town.

     Little Ronny has to run the errand of his life. A man from
     Scottland Yard promised him a huge reward and a ticket to the
     next roller-skating championships for delivering an outstandingly
     important and top secret message at 210, Humpty Street at the other
     end of the town. 
     But this job is going to be a hell of a crux, and Ronny has to get
     there at his own expenses and risks. There are buses to catch and many
     obstacles to surmount, requireing an excessive deal of strategy,
     wit, and skill. 

     Ronny never goes on his errands without a couple of bags of home-made
     peppermint-flavoured marshmallows with garlic icing. The particular
     fragrance (ignorant people may call it "stench") of this specialty is
     effective indeed!!!
     That's why Ronny shoots it at all the objects he wants to get out
     of his way. To make use of these "lethal sweets" just press the
     fire button on your joystick. However, the marshmallows have no
     effect on pedestrians and some other moving objects which are used
     to English eating habits. 

     The levels and its inhabitants are "genuine imitations" of an
     English town and of prototypical English people and thingumbobs.
     So, regardless wether you are carrying out love letters or wether
     you are about to run away from the police or from a weird table lamp  
     shooting bulbs after you, never forget to say "please", mind your
     pronunciation and attitudes, and try to get used to the English
     sense of humor. 
     Have fun and enjoy the crazy world of ROLLING RONNY!



Getting Around:
---------------
                        Joystick movements
                        ------------------

              Jump left        Jump        Jump right
                            (Climb up)
         

             Skate left     Fire=Shoot     Skate right

   
                           (Climb down)    
                   Duck        Duck        Duck


     You generally can skate on all smooth and plain surfaces in-
     cluding railtracks, window sills, breast walls, etc.
    
     Avoid touching grassy ground, puddles or water, and beware of
     pitfalls and all moving obstacles (including pedestrians).

     Tumbling is caused by unfit ground, pitfalls or collisions
     with some moving objects. A balloon will appear each time you
     tumbled, carrying you up in the air. While floating, you can
     move Ronny backwards out of the dangerous area onto safe ground.
    
     When near a ladder, the upward and downward movements of the
     joystick make Ronny - instead of jumping and ducking - climb up
     or down the ladder.
  

Text Windows:
-------------
     In certain situations a text window pops up on the screen and
     the game action will be paused. These windows are the means by
     which you can have Ronny communicate with the characters of the
     Game and make stratetic decisions. The highlighted text indicates
     the action which you will perform by pressing the fire button on
     the joystick. When several options are available, highlight the
     option of your choice by moving the joystick up or down and then
     press the fire button. 


Money:
------
     Try to get as much money as you possibly can (it's quite like in
     real life, isn't it?). Besides the money you get with your errands
     there is always the possibility to collect the coins people lost in
     the streets.

     At the end of each level you will have to buy a ticket at the bus
     stop and take the bus to the next level. Make sure to dispose of
     enough money when arriving at the bus stop. The average fare is about
     110 pence. These tickets are expensive! But Ronny would never make
     it to his destination without the help of public transportation. 

     Each penny of the money remaining after having purchased your ticket
     at the end of each Level will be transformed into 500 points on
     your score. 

     Ronny usually offers his seat to elderly women in crowded buses.
     That is why he leaves the bus with a nice tip of ten cents at the
     beginning of each new level. 


Errands:
--------
     From time to time (most likely in front of house entrances or when
     facing pedestrians) you will be offered an errand. 
     Just touch the glass bobbles with the rotating sign inside reading
     "J O B" whenever you happen to come across them. This then offers
     you the possibility to accept a job and earn a good deal of money.

     The conditions and terms of delivery and payment, as well as the
     destination address, will be displayed in the window that pops up.
     Some errands will bring you generous tips, and promise a load of
     bonus points.
     Decide very carefully whether you want to accept the job or not!
     You certainly are in need of money for your bus ticket, but on
     the other hand, each going on an errand can severely endanger your
     health and energy supply...

     When offered an errand, you generally have three options:   
                    
          - Accepting the errand on suggested terms.

          - Bargaining and trying to raise the amount of money offered
            for the suggested errand.

          - Rejecting the errand.

     You have the possibility to bargain as often as you like. But don't
     push your luck too hard! The customers may get tired of your bar-
     gaining and lower their offer or quit business with you once and
     for all. 

     When you finally accept the terms for an errand, the item which
     you have to deliver is handed over to you and appears in the panel
     display (F1-F4) at the bottom of your screen. Pressing the according
     F-key lets pop up a window reminding you again of the terms for this
     particular errand.(not yet implemented)

     You can go (or rather skate) on several errands simultaneously. But
     you can't carry more than four items (including gadgets) at the same
     time.

     Having successfully delivered an item at its destination, another
     window pops up containing the receivers comment and the money and
     the bonus points for this particular errand will both be added up
     to the total.

     Each completed errand is worth a certain amount of points. The total
     of this points is shown in the BONUS display in the panel. As soon
     as an errand is completed successfully the points are added up to
     the score.(not yet implemented)


Cubes:
------
     Each rotating little cube collected is worth 50 points.

     You positively absolutly must collect all but three cubes in each
     level to be able to proceed to the next level. Choose very carefully
     the three cubes you do NOT want to collect, because you have
     to pick up all the other cubes!

     Each of the five optional cubes collected is worth 300 points. 
     Collecting all the cubes in a level (including the three optional
     cubes) will be rewarded with 3000 points extra.


Shooting:
---------
     Each shot with a marshmallow will cost you some energy. You can shoot
     most (but not all) of the moving objects to get them out of your way
     except for people and domestic animals (is a monkey on a skateboard
     considered a domestic animal?). The number of shots is not limited,
     but watch your energy level! You can't release shots when on a
     ladder or while ducking. Most of the moving objects require more
     than one hit to get them out of your way.


Energy:
-------
     Skating around will decrease your energy minimally, while climbing
     ladders, jumping and shooting will consume more energy.

     Touching an energy ball or purchasing energy supplying items in
     a shop will increase your energy level immediately.


Health:
-------
     The following actions will make you tumble and thus cost you some
     health:

          - falling into ditches and pits

          - severe collisions with obstacles and moving objects

          - touching ground or surface unfit for roller-skates
            (grass, water, pebbles, puddles etc.)

     Catching a health ball or buying health supplying items in a shop
     will increase your health level at once.


Shops:
------
     When touching a shop sign a text window will pop up displaying all
     the items and gadgets offered in this shop including their prices.
     Select an item to purchase or exit the menue. When you buy a health
     or energy supplying item you will immediately profit from its effect.


Gadgets:
--------
     Some shops offer gadgets to improve your equipment. Occasionally
     you may also find a gadget in the street. You can't carry more than
     four of them (including items to be delivered).
     
     There are situations where the use of such a gadget can prevent
     you from severe loss of health or energy. 

     When you find yourself in a particularly difficult situation, think
     very carefully about the effect of the gadget before you use it. 

     The following gadgets are available:

          - Superjump: lets you perform consecutively three jumps about
                       three times higher and longer than a regular jump.
                       4 pence each.

          - Megahonk : neglects collisions for 5 seconds during which
                       Ronny is flickering. 3 pence each.

          - Magnetofluct: collects all bonus items on current screen
                          (health and energy balls, rotating cubes and
                          questionmarks, coins) and lets you profit from
                          their effect. 3 pence each.

          - Stenchalizer: paralizes all moving objects on current screen
                          for some seconds. 2 pence each.
     
          - Powersneeze: makes disappear all dangerous objects on current
                         screen (not the bonus items). 5 pence each.
            

     To activate a gadget, press the corresponding F-key. The gadget is 
     in use as soon as it disappears from the item display in the panel.


Surprise:
---------
     The rotating red question-marks reveal their surprising effect
     as soon as you touch them. They can positively affect your money,
     health or energy. But not quite all question-marks are friendly!
     (That is what surprises are all about, is it not?)


Lost Properties:
----------------
     A bubbling exclamation-mark stands for lost property. Pick it up,
     return it to the address displayed in the window which will appear,
     and you may get a bulk of points on your score and a fine reward
     from the owner ... hopefully. However you are not fined in case
     you are not able to return the lost property to its owner.(not yet
     implemented)


Game Over:
----------
     The game is over when

          - you are not healthy enough to carry on your errands (watch
            the health level display).

          - you are out of power and lack the energy to move on (watch
            the energy level display).

          - you spoiled too many of your errands or were not able to
            pick up enough coins in the street and are thus short of the
            110 cents which you need in order to purchase a bus ticket
            to the next level.

          - you could not collect all but three cubes of the current
            level.


Saving the Game:
----------------
     At the end of each level, after having entered the bus, you have
     the possibility to relax and save the current game and score.
     The CONTINUE GAME option in the main menue then allows you to
     directly access, load and continue a previously saved game.


Music and Sound:
----------------
     Press the M key to stop and start the music, press the S key to
     stop and start the sound effects.
